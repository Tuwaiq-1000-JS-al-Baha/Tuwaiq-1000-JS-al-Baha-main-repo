## Conditionals


### The World Translator
Write an if statement that writes Hello World in different languages (i.e. if the language is English, print "Hello World", if the language is Arabic write something "مرحبا بالعالم", if the language is French write something romantic)


### Driving Age
Store the user age
If age is less than 18, print "Sorry, you can't drive yet"
If the age is equal to or over 18, print "You can drive, nice car by the way"
Bonus:
If the user can't drive yet, tell them how many years they will have to wait. E.g. "Sorry, you have 4 years to wait until you can drive"
